<p>Partnered with Nestle and launched after a special ad campaign, the KitKat version remains the most controversial release of the Android brand so far. The partnership with Nestle was done to get a trendy dessert name as the <strong><em>OS version name</em></strong>. The Jelly Bean feature was updated here. Despite not receiving many accolades, its hallmark features are:</p>

<h3>Better Memory Management</h3>
<p>KitKat is <strong>designed to run on devices with as little as 512MB of RAM</strong>. Google has implemented behind-the-scenes improvements to Android 4.4&rsquo;s memory management, and will be providing developers and OEM manufacturers with tools and options to take advantage of these improvements. These memory improvements are expected to lead to<strong> smoother multi-tasking</strong> as well. </p>
<p>The fact that <a rel="external" href="http://bgr.com/2013/10/03/android-jelly-bean-adoption-rate/">less than half</a> of all Android phones are running Android 4.x has led to fragmentation issues within Android. It looks like these memory optimizations may lead to <strong>greater adoption of Android 4.4</strong>, and this should help unify Android to some extent.</p>

<h3>Improved Google Now</h3>
<p>You can now <strong>activate Google Now by simply saying "OK Google"</strong>. It&rsquo;s only available to Nexus 5 for now though. The <strong>contextual cards</strong> feature also gets an upgrade. Google Now cards will try to predict information you need based on your location, favorite sites or TV programs.</p>
<p>In addition, Android 4.4 features a new <strong>app-linking </strong>feature, which allows Google Search to <strong>deep-link search results to applications</strong> installed on a user&rsquo;s device. So, for instance, searching for a restaurant via Google Now can direct you to a restaurant reservation app such as OpenTable, ready to make a reservation for that particular restaurant.</p>

<h3>Hangouts App Upgraded</h3>
<p>The old Android messaging app is now a thing of the past with KitKat. Instead, Google Hangouts now supports <strong>SMS and MMS</strong>, so all your messages will be in the same app. Hangouts will also be getting <strong>support for HD video calls</strong> across all devices.</p>
<p><span class="s450-550">Video and voice calling have also <strong>been improved</strong>, to make Hangouts an all-in-one solution to your communication needs. In addition, <strong>animated GIFs</strong> and <strong>location sharing</strong> through Google Maps will be supported.</span></p>

<h3>Immersive Mode</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it; Android&rsquo;s status bar and navigation buttons can sometimes get in the way, especially when you&rsquo;re playing a game, reading eBooks or watching videos. Fortunately, Android 4.4 comes with a new <strong>immersive mode</strong> that <strong>hides everything except the app you&rsquo;re using</strong>. Once you&rsquo;re done, just <strong>swipe the edge of the screen</strong> to bring back your status bar and navigation buttons.</p>

<h3>System-Wide Closed Captioning</h3>
<p>Android 4.4 improves user accesibility by adding support for <strong>system-wide closed captioning</strong> settings. You can set whether captions should be shown, the language captions will be shown for, and text-related settings such as size and font. Apps that use video <strong>will be able to access these settings</strong> and <strong>show on screen captions</strong> based on your settings.</p>
