<h2>Features in Android 8.0 Oreo</h2>
<h3>Autofill Your Passwords</h3>
<p>Unlike previous versions of Android which required workarounds, Android Oreo allows Essential users to autofill their login information into an app. By default, this feature uses passwords from your Google account, but all the major password managers currently support the new API. With this new feature, setting up your new Essential is much easier. Once your password manager is downloaded and unlocked, you can quickly log into your favorite app and access your accounts.</p>

<h3>Picture-in-Picture Mode for Netflix</h3>
<p>Probably one of the biggest front-end changes in Android 8.0 was the inclusion of picture-in-picture mode. While watching a video or receiving turn-by-turn directions, you could reduce the content to a small floating window by just pressing the home button.</p><p>While this feature is still present, Netflix is now among the supported apps in in Essential's Android 8.1 update. Netflix decided that it wouldn't support PiP mode without the absolute latest version of Android. Fortunately, with the latest build, Essential users don't have to worry.</p>

<h3>New Power Menu</h3>
<p>With Android 8.1 Oreo, the power menu has been altered, with one of the more noticeable changes being its reduced size. In addition, it fades in from the right edge of the display (near the top). While it offers little in terms of function, it a welcome cleaner change to the menu.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Calendar and Clock Icons</h3>
<p>While this feature is limited to Essential's default launcher, the clock and calendar icons will adjust depending on the time and day. Instead of the default 31st on the calendar app, the icon will now alter based on the actual day of the month, while the clock will show the current time. It a small change, but one that's definitely appreciated.</p>

<h3>Semi-Transparent Quick Settings Menu</h3>
<p>The Quick Settings menu is also semi-transparent now, allowing users to somewhat see the previous screen. This feature is visible with either background color and offers a small change to the Quick Settings.</p>

<h3>Redesigned Navigation Buttons</h3>
<p>The navigation buttons have received a change in their design to help stress the Google Assistant. The back and recent apps buttons have been reduced in size in comparison to the home button. The home button received an additional circle providing more emphasis on the button, which brings up the Google Assistant when long-pressed.</p>
