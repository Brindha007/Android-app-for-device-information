<p>Android shed away the older DALVIK runtime with this version and introduced the new runtime Art with this version. Few of its hallmark features included:-</p>

<h3>Memory leak seems to be gone</h3>
<p>It's still early days yet, but attempts to test the notorious memory leak problem on the <a href="https://www.androidpit.com/device/google-nexus-5" target="_top">Nexus 5</a> on <a href="https://www.androidpit.com/topic/android-5-0-1-lollipop" target="_top">Android 5.0.1</a> seems to have been dealt with. We'll hold our breath a little bit longer for the confirmation, but for now, it looks like the memory leak has been patched.</p>

<h3>Lock screen changes</h3>
<p>On Android 5.1 when you press on the lock screen without swiping, you'll get a little bounce action that reminds you it's a swipeable screen. This was preview in Android L but didn't seem to make it to <a href="https://www.androidpit.com/topic/android-5-0-lollipop" target="_top">Android 5.0</a>.</p>

<h3>LED works in all sound modes</h3>
<p>The LED light now works in all sound modes, including ''silent'' mode. Sadly, the standard mute mode (accessed previously by hitting volume down all the way) has still not been resurrected in Android 5.1, but you can achieve the same effect by selecting ''None'' in your volume widget: no noises, no vibrations. Speaking of sound, NuPlayer replaces AwesomePlayer as the default streaming content&nbsp;player in Android 5.1.</p>

<h3>New sound widget icons</h3>
<p>In Android 5.0 you had a simple volume slider with three entries beneath it: None, Priority and All. The Android Team apparently felt this was a little too vague so they've now added a couple of icons to help you along: a crossed circle for None, a star for Priority Interruptions only, and a ringing bell for all. Makes sense.</p>

<h3>New clear all notifications animation</h3>
<p>When you tap the ''clear all'' notifications button you'll now get a nice little animation as all those notifications are whisked away to never never land.</p>
