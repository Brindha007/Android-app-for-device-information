<p>This version of the Android was introduced merely to fit the OS on the large screen of the tablet. It never saw the mobile platform. Its features included:</p>
<h3>Better Multitasking</h3>
<p>Previously, the bar for recently opened apps was a static stack of thumbnails. Now you can scroll up and down your list of apps you have open. Just hit the button on the homescreen and flick. Much better.</p>

<h3>Movie Store</h3>
<p>Unlike iOS, Android hasn&#39;t had the luxury of Netflix and Hulu to provide streaming video, nor has it had any sort of rental store. Netflix is a work in progress, but Honeycomb now has a movie rental store that gives you access to thousands of movies. Standard definition rentals are $3, and HD rentals are $4, with no subscription plan available. It&#39;s not as nuanced as Netflix—in selection or design—but if you need something to watch in a pinch, it does its job.</p>

<h3>Resizable Homescreen Widgets</h3>
<p>If you like widgets, but want <em>more</em> out of them, you can resize them to make &#39;em bigger. To do that, hold your finger down over the widget until a blue frame appears over it. then drag the diamonds to resize said widget as you see fit. A blessing for Gmail.</p>

<h3>Pointer Device Support</h3>
<p>For the first time, Android supports pointer devices, which includes mice, trackpads and trackballs. Apple&#39;s Magic Trackpad even works with Honeycomb 3.1, although multitouch gestures aren&#39;t supoorted. All you have to do is make your Bluetooth device discoverable, head to the settings menu and let Android handle the rest. It won&#39;t replace the need to touch the screen, but it will make things more efficient when using a hardware keyboard.</p>

<h3>USB Host</h3>
<p>Android 3.1 now accepts USB devices as a host, meaning thumbdrives, cameras, keyboards and USB peripherals—like gamepads—are accessible/functional on the Xoom. Play games, access files, offload photos. We weren&#39;t able to test this out, because the Xoom only has a micro USB port which requires an OBSCURE adapter. But we do suspect that when working on other devices (or even the Xoom), it will be awesome.</p>

<h3>Updated Core Apps</h3>
<p>Browser has an updated Quick Controls UI that now lets you quickly view open tabs, and access settings, supports embedded HTML5 video and enables hardware acceleration. The Calendar app has been redesigned for easier readability and more accurate touch controls. The email widget now lets you access multiple folders (can&#39;t do this with Gmail, however). And contacts are now fully searchable, meaning it will look for more than just name and number when searching.</p>
